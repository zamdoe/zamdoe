- 👋 Hi, I’m @zamdoe
- 👀 I’m interested in process optimization and control considering uncertainty, and thermal energy storage applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a PhD in the Process Systems Engineering group at NTNU. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on fast and robust nonlinear model predictive control based on parametric NLP sensitivity, and/or application of data science to improve robust NMPC controller performance. 
- 📫 How to reach me? Email me at zawadi.n.mdoe@ntnu.no
